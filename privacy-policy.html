						<h3><span>Your personal data and clinicians</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						7. As a patient of Audiology Plus, your treatment may be provided by a clinician who is a
						medical practitioner. Audiology Plus are a Data Controller in respect of your personal
						information which they hold within those records, meaning that they must comply with the data
						protection legislation and relevant guidance when handling your personal information. To the
						extent relevant to their practice, you can expect clinicians (and the Referral Management Team)
						to handle your information in line with this Privacy Notice. This includes using your personal
						information as set out in more detail below.
					</p>

					<div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
						<h3><span>What personal information do we collect and use from patients?</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						8. The personal information that we collect will depend on your relationship with us. We will
						collect different information depending on whether or not you are already a patient of Audiology
						Plus.
						<br><br>
						9. We may use “special categories of personal information” (otherwise known as "special
						categories of data") about you, such as information relating to your physical and mental health.
						For example, if you are a patient we will need to use information about your health in order to
						treat you.
						<br><br>
						10. If you provide personal information to us about other individuals (including medical or
						financial information) you should inform the individual about the contents of this Privacy
						Notice. We will process such information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
						<br><br>
						11. In addition, you should note that in the event you amend data which we already hold about
						you (for instance by amending a pre-populated form) then we will update our systems to reflect
						the amendments. Our systems will continue to store historical data.

						<h3><span>Special Categories Personal Information</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						13. As a patient of Audiology Plus, we will hold information relating to your medical treatment
						which is known as a special category of personal data under the law, meaning that it must be
						handled even more sensitively. The special categories of personal information we hold about you
						may include the following:

					<ul class="privacy-policy-ul">
						<li>
							Details of your current or former physical or mental health. This may include
							information about any healthcare you have received (both from Audiology Plus directly
							and other healthcare providers such as GPs, dentists or hospitals (private and/or NHS))
							or need, including about clinic and hospital visits and medicines administered. We
							provide further details below on the manner in which we handle such information.

							ethnicityd) Details of your religione) Details of any genetic data or biometric data
							relating to you f) Data concerning your sex life and/or sexual orientation.

					</ul>

					14. The confidentiality of your medical information is important to Audiology Plus. We make
					every effort to prevent unauthorised access to and use of information relating to your current
					or former physical and mental health. In doing so, Audiology Plus complies with UK data
					protection law, including the Data Protection Act 2018, and all applicable medical
					confidentiality guidelines issued by professional bodies including, but not limited to, RCCP and
					HCPC.
					<br><br>
					15. From 25 May 2018, the current Data Protection Act will be replaced by the EU General Data
					Protection Regulation (<strong>GDPR</strong>) and a new Data Protection Act. All uses of
					Audiology Plus information will comply with the GDPR and the new Data Protection Act from that
					date onwards.
					</p>

					<div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
						<h3><span>How do we collect your information?</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						16. We may collect personal information from a number of different sources including, but not
						limited to

					<ul class="privacy-policy-ul">
						<li>GPs</li>
						<li>Dentists</li>
						<li>Other hospitals, both NHS and private</li>
						<li>Mental health providers</li>
						<li>Commissioners of healthcare services</li>
						<li>Clinicians (including the Referral Management Team)</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
						<h3><span>Directly from you</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						17. Information may be collected directly from you when

					<ul class="privacy-policy-ul">
						<li>You enter into a contract with Audiology Plus for the provision of healthcare services
						</li>
						<li>You use those services</li>
						<li>You complete enquiry forms on the Audiology Plus website</li>

							Plus in a public social media post</li>
						<li>You take part in our marketing activities</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
						<h3><span>From other healthcare organisations</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						18. Our patients will usually receive healthcare from other organisations in addition to
						Audiology Plus, and so in order to provide you with the best treatment possible we may have to
						collect personal informationabout you from other organisations. These may include:

					<ul class="privacy-policy-ul">
						<li>Medical records from your GP</li>
						<li>Medical records from your clinician (including the referral management team)</li>
						<li>Medical records from your dentist</li>
						<li>Medical records from the NHS or any private healthcare organisation</li>
					</ul>

					19. Medical records include information about your diagnosis, clinic and hospital visits and
					medicines administered.

					</p>

					<div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
						<h3><span>From third parties</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						20. As detailed in the previous section, it is often necessary to seek information from other
						healthcareorganisations. We may also collect information about you from third parties when:

					<ul class="privacy-policy-ul">
						<li>You are referred to us for the provision of services including healthcare services</li>
						<li>We liaise with your current or former employer, health professional or other treatment
							or benefit provider</li>
						<li>We liaise with your family</li>
						<li>We liaise with your insurance policy provider</li>
						<li>We deal with experts (including medical experts) and other service providers about
							services you have received or are receiving from us</li>
						<li>We deal with NHS health service bodies about services you have received or are receiving
							from us</li>
						<li>We liaise with credit reference agencies</li>
						<li>We liaise with debt collection agencies</li>
						<li>We liaise with Government agencies, including the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office
							and HMRC</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
						<h3><span>How will we communicate with you?</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						21. In order to communicate with you, we are likely to do this by telephone, SMS, email, and/or
						post. If we contact you using the telephone number(s) which you have provided (landline and/or
						mobile), and you are not available which results in the call being directed to a voicemail
						and/or answering service, we may leave a voice message on your voicemail and/or answering
						service as appropriate.
						<br><br>
						22. However:
					<ul class="privacy-policy-ul">
						<li>to ensure that we provide you with timely updates and reminders in relation to your
							healthcare (including basic administration information and appointment information
							(including reminders), we may communicate with you by SMS and/or unencrypted email
							(where you have provided us with your email address) in each case where you have
							expressed a preference in the patient registration form to be contacted by SMS and/or
							email
						</li>
						<li>
							to provide you with your medical information (including test results and other clinical
							updates) and/or invoicing information, we may communicate with you by email (which will
							be encrypted) where you have provided us with your email address and have expressed a
							preference in the patient registration form to be contacted by email. The first time we
							send you any important encrypted email eg one that we are not also sending by post or
							which requires action to be taken, we will endeavour to contact you separately to ensure
							that you are able to access the encrypted email you are sent.
						</li>
						<li>
							If we have your mobile number or your email address we may use this method of
							communication to contact you regarding patient surveys which are for the purpose of
							improving our service or monitoring outcomes and are not a form of marketing.
						</li>
					</ul>
					23. Please note that although providing your mobile number and email address and stating a
					preference to be communicated by a particular method will be taken as an affirmative
					confirmation that you are happy for us to contact you in that manner, we are not relying on your
					consent to process your personal data in order to correspond with you about your treatment. As
					set out further below, processing your personal data for those purposes is justified on the
					basis that it is necessary to provide you with healthcare services.
					</p>

					<div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
						<h3><span>Surveys</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						24. As detailed above, we may contact you to ask you to participate in surveys regarding your
						treatment with Audiology Plus. The surveys will largely be sent post-treatment at clinic by
						email or SMS. This is not a form of marketing and the surveys do not try to sell you any further
						products or services; it is solely to gather information relating to your experience of
						Audiology Plus, for the purposes of improving the quality and safety of the services we offer to
						future patients. It is necessary for us to process your personal data in order to contact you
						with these surveys, on the basis of our appropriate business needs and to improve the quality of
						the healthcare services we offer (as set out under purpose 8 below). Participation in the
						surveys is entirely voluntary. You may decide not to complete the surveys and you will have the
						option to unsubscribe from receiving further survey invitations. You may also be given the
						opportunity to proactively opt into receiving a call back to further discussyour survey
						responses. These are all matters entirely for you.
					</p>

					<div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
						<h3><span>What are the purposes for which your information is used?</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						25. We may 'process' your information for a number of different purposes, which is essentially
						the language used by the law to mean using your data. Each time we use your data we must have a
						legal justification to do so. The particular justification will depend on the purpose of the
						proposed use of your data. When the information that we process is classed as “special category
						of personal information”, we must have a specific additional legal justification in order to use
						it as proposed.
						<br><br>
						26. Generally we will rely on the following legal justifications, or 'grounds':

					<ul class="privacy-policy-ul">
						<li>
							Taking steps at your request so that you can enter into a contract with Audiology Plus
							and/or clinician to receive healthcare services from us
						</li>
						<li>
							For the purposes of providing you with healthcare pursuant to a contract between you and
							Audiology Plus and/or clinician. We will rely on this for activities such as supporting
							your medical treatment or care and other benefits, supporting your doctor, nurse, carer
							or other healthcare professional and providing other services to you
						</li>
						<li>
							We have an appropriate business need to process your personal information and such
							business need does not cause harm to you. We will rely on this for activities such as
							quality assurance, maintaining our business records, developing and improving our
							products and services and monitoring outcomes
						</li>
						<li>
							We have a legal or regulatory obligation to use such personal information
						</li>
						<li>
							We need to use such personal information to establish, exercise or defend our legal
							rights
						</li>
						<li>
							You have provided your consent to our use of your personal information.
						</li>
					</ul>
					27. Note that failure to provide your information further to a contractual requirement with us
					or a clinician may mean that we are unable to set you up as a patient or facilitate the
					provision of your healthcare on Audiology Plus systems.
					<br><br>
					28. We provide further detail on these grounds in the sections below.

					</p>

					<div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
						<h3><span>Appropriate business needs</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						29. One legal ground for processing personal data is where we do this in pursuit of legitimate
						interests and those interests are not overridden by your privacy rights. Where we refer to use
						for our appropriate business needs, we are relying on this legal ground.
						<br><br>
						30. Special categories of personal information includes information about your:

					<ul class="privacy-policy-ul">
						<li>Health</li>
						<li>Sex life</li>
						<li>Sexual orientation</li>
						<li>Ethnicity</li>
						<li>Political opinions</li>
						<li>Religious or philosophical beliefs</li>
						<li>Genetic or biometric information</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<div class="fancy-title title-bottom-border">
						<h3><span>The right to object to other uses of your personal data</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						31. You have a range of rights in respect of your personal data, as set out in detail in
						sections 78 to 90. This includes the right to object to Audiology Plus using your personal
						information in a particular way (such as sharing that information with third parties), and we
						must stop using it in that way unless specific exceptions apply. This includes, for example, if
						it is necessary to defend a legal claim brought against us, or it is otherwise necessary for the
						purposes of your ongoing treatment.
						<br><br>
						<strong>
							You will find details of our legal grounds for each of our processing purposes below. We
							have set out individually those purposes for which we will use your personal information,
							and under each one we set out the legal justifications, or grounds, which allow us to do so.
							You will note that we have set out a legal ground, as well as an 'additional' legal ground
							for special categories of personal information. This is because we have to demonstrate
							additional legal grounds where we are using information which relates to a person's
							healthcare, as we will be the majority of the times we use your personal information.
						</strong>

						<hr>
						<br>

					<h4 class="center">
						<strong>Purpose 1: </strong><em>To set you up as a patient on Audiology Plus’s systems
							including carrying out fraud, credit, anti-money laundering and other regulatory
							checks.</em>
					</h4>

					32. As is common with most business, we have to carry out necessary checks in order for you to
					become a patient. These include standard background checks, which we cannot perform without
					using your personal information.
					<br><br>
					33. <strong>Legal ground:</strong> Taking the necessary steps so that you can enter into a
					contract with us for the delivery of healthcare.
					<br><br>
					34. <strong>Additional legal ground for special categories of personal information:</strong> The
					use is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest.

					<hr>
					<br>

					<h4 class="center">
						<strong>Purpose 2: </strong><em>To provide you with healthcare and related services.</em>
					</h4>

					35. Clearly, the reason you come to us is to provide you with healthcare, and so we have to use
					your personal information for that.
					<br><br>
					36. Legal grounds:
					<ul class="privacy-policy-ul">
						<li>Providing you with healthcare and related services</li>
						<li>Fulfilling our contract with you for the delivery of healthcare</li>

					<h4 class="center"><strong>Purpose 4: </strong><em>For medical audit/research purposes</em></h4>
					40. Audiology Plus may process your personal data for the purposes of local clinical audit –
					i.e. an audit carried out by your direct care team for the purposes of assessing outcomes for
					patients and identifying improvements which could be made for the future. We are able to do so
					on the basis of a legitimate interest and the public interest in statistical and scientific
					research, and with appropriate safeguards in place. You are, however, entitled to object to us
					using your personal data for this purpose, and as a result of which we would need to stop doing
					so. If you would like to raise such an objection then please contact our Data Protection Officer
					using the details provided in above.
					<br><br>
					41. We may also be asked to share information with UK registries for which ethical approval is
					not necessarily required but which form part of the National Clinical Audit programme, hosted by
					NHS England and who provide a list of National Clinical Audit and Clinical Outcome Review
					programmes and other quality improvement programmes which we should prioritise for
					participation.
					<br><br>
					42. A full copy of the current list can be found at https://www.hqip.org.uk/list which comprises
					the national organisations with whom we regularly share data for the purposes of audit. We may
					also share your data with other audit programmes which are set up by professional associations.
					<br><br>
					43. We may do so without your consent provided that the particular audit registry has received
					statutory approval, or where the information will be provided in a purely anonymous form,
					otherwise your consent will be needed. In those circumstances, the relevant registry
					organisation may have consent processes of their own so any questions in that regard should be
					directed to the organisations themselves, otherwise we will obtain that consent from you.

						44. Audiology Plus also participates in medical research and shares data with ethically approved

						<br><br>
						45. We will share your personal data only to the extent that it is necessary to do so in
						assisting research and as permitted by law. Some research projects and/or registries have
						received statutory approval such that consent may not be required in order to use your personal
						data. In those circumstances, your personal will be shared on the basis that:

						<br>
						b) The processing is necessary in the public interest for statistical and scientific research
						purposes.
						<br><br>
						46. In the event that consent is required then either the research organisations will obtain
						this from you themselves, and so any questions in that regard should be directed to them, or we
						will take consent from you.

					<h4 class="center">
						<strong>Purpose 5: </strong><em>Communicating with you and resolving any queries or

					47. From time to time, patients may raise queries, or even complaints, with Audiology Plus and

					and properly, and so we will need to use your personal information in order to do so.
					<br><br>

					<h4 class="center">
						<strong>Purpose 7: </strong><em>Complying with our legal or regulatory obligations, and

					54. As a provider of healthcare, we are subject to a wide range of legal and regulatory

					regulators to provide personal information, and in which case we will have a legal
					responsibility to do so. From time to time, Audiology Plus and its clinicians are also the

					57. Audiology Plus is a quality-conscious organisation, and always looking to learn from
					patients’ experiences in order to improve the experience for future patients. With that in mind,
					we will use your personal information to identify where such improvements can be made, such as
					reviewing recorded phone calls to assess whether anything can be learnt and contacting you to
					seek your valuable thoughts on the experience with us.

						<strong>Purpose 9: </strong><em>Managing our business operations such as maintaining
