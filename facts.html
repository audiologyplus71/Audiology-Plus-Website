											<h2>Conductive hearing loss</h2>
											<img class="alignleft img-responsive" src="images/facts/hearing.jpg" alt="">
											<div>
												Conductive hearing loss is caused by anything that interferes with the
												transmission
												of sound from the outer to the inner ear.
												Below are some possible causes of conductive hearing loss:
												<br><br>
												<ul>
													<li>Middle ear infections (otitis media)</li>
													<li>Collection of fluid in the middle ear (“glue ear”)</li>
													<li>Blockage of the outer ear, most commonly by wax</li>
													<li>Otosclerosis, a condition in which the ossicles of the middle
														ear harden and
														become less mobile</li>
													<li>Damage to the ossicles, for example by serious infection or head
														injury</li>
													<li>Perforated (pierced) eardrum, which can be caused by an
														untreated ear
														infection, head injury or a blow to the ear, or from poking
														something in your
														ear</li>
												</ul>
												<br>
												Conductive hearing loss means that sound isn&#39;t conducted adequately
												through your
												outer ear canal to the eardrum and the tiny bones, or ossicles, of your
												middle ear.
												Conductive hearing loss generally involves a reduction in sound level
												and results in
												the inability to hear faint sounds. However, you can still hear people
												speaking to you,
												but their speech may sound muffled, weak or far away. <br><br>
												Conductive hearing loss may occur in conjunction with sensorineural
												hearing loss or
												on its own. Most conductive hearing losses affect all frequencies of
												your hearing
												evenly and they don&#39;t usually result in severe hearing losses. A
												person with a
												conductive hearing loss is usually able to use a hearing aid or can have
												their hearing
												loss treated and corrected medically or surgically.

											<h2>Sensorineural hearing loss</h2>
											<img class="alignright img-responsive" src="images/facts/ear-diagram.jpg"
												alt="">
											<div>
												Sensorineural hearing loss is due to damage to the pathway that sends
												impulses
												taken from the hair cells of the inner ear to the auditory nerve and the
												brain. Below are some possible causes: <br><br>
												<ul>
													<li>Age-related hearing loss (presbyacusis). This is the natural
														decline in hearing that many people experience as they get
														older. It’s partly due to the loss of hair cells in the cochlea
													</li>
													<li>Acoustic trauma (injury caused by loud noise) can damage hair
														cell</li>
													<li>Certain viral or bacterial infections such as mumps or
														meningitis can lead to loss of hair cells or other damage to the
														auditory nerve</li>
													<li>Meniere’s disease, which causes dizziness, tinnitus, and hearing
														loss</li>
													<li>
														Certain drugs, such as some powerful antibiotics, can cause
														permanent hearing loss. At high doses, Aspirin is thought to
														cause temporary tinnitus (a persistent ringing in the ears). The
														antimalarial drug/Quinine can also cause tinnitus, but it’s not
														thought to cause permanent damage
													</li>
													<li>Acoustic neuroma, which is a benign (non-cancerous) tumour that
														affects the auditory nerve, needs to be observed and is
														sometimes treated with surgery</li>

											<h2>Tinnitus</h2>
											<img class="alignleft img-responsive" src="images/facts/tinnitus.jpg"
												alt="">
											<div>
												The word <i>&#39;tinnitus&#39;</i> comes from the Latin word for
												<i>&#39;ringing&#39;</i> and is the awareness of sound in
												the absence of any parallel external sound. This noise may be heard in
												one ear, in both ears
												or in the middle of the head. It is also sometimes difficult for the
												patient to pinpoint its
												exact location. This noise can range from a low to high frequency, and
												it may be a single
												noise or two or more components. Tinnitus can take many forms, the most
												common are:
												buzzing, whistling and hissing, some patients even hear music,
												nevertheless this is much
												rarer and is called a musical hallucination, but it is still a form of
												tinnitus. It can be
												intermittent or constant. Tinnitus is not a disease or an illness, it is
												a symptom produced
												within a person&#39;s own auditory pathways and is not caused as often
												assume by disease of
												the ears. The precise cause of tinnitus is still not fully understood.
												<br><br>
												According to The British Tinnitus Association, around 10% of the
												population have tinnitus but for around 600,000 people in the UK it can
												be distressing. Tinnitus is very common in all age groups. There is a
												widely held misconception that tinnitus is confined to the elderly, but
												various studies have shown that it can occur at any age, even in quite
												young children. Mild tinnitus is very common, a majority of people have
												it all the time, however it may also affect the quality of some people's
												life.
												<br><br>
												Tinnitus can affect people in different ways. Most people are not
												troubled by it as they have learned to leave with it, some may only
												notice it at quiet times, perhaps when they are trying to sleep. Others
												however, find that their tinnitus bother them in their everyday life.
												<br><br>
												The impact of suffering from Tinnitus is often taken too lightly.
												Research has shown that, for some people, tinnitus can lead to
												depression, anxiety, stress and sleep problems. It can also have a
												negative effect on their personal and professional life. Unfortunately,
												if you are stressed or anxious about your tinnitus, it is possible that
												it may worsen. If this happens, don’t worry, there are lots of things
												you can do to help break this cycle and reduce the impact that the
												condition has on your life. Specialist support from the audiologist, GP
												or even counselling can help to alleviate the distress.
												<br><br>
												Tinnitus is more common in people with hearing loss; however you can
												have normal hearing and still have tinnitus. There are many different
												causes and triggers such as those shown below, but many people may have
												tinnitus without ever having experienced any of these provoking factors:
												<br><br>
												<ul>
													<li>Noise exposure</li>
													<li>Ear infections</li>
													<li>Some ear diseases</li>
													<li>Head or neck injuries</li>
													<li>Circulation problems</li>
													<li>Side effects of certain medicines</li>
													<li>Stress</li>
												</ul> <br>
												Straining to listen causes increased central auditory gain (remember
												it’s the brain that turns up the tinnitus) and this increased
												sensitivity can allow tinnitus to occur, or if already present, it may
												worsen. By wearing hearing aids you are reducing this strain and the
												brains' desire to increase the central auditory gain to hear the sound.
												Hearing aids are known to be helpful in the management of tinnitus, even
												if the hearing loss is relatively mild and an aid would not have
												normally been considered.
												<br><br>
												<h3>How do hearing aids help reduce tinnitus?</h3>

												<ul>
													<li>Improve communication</li>
													<li>Divert attention from the tinnitus</li>
													<li>Background sounds amplified, decreasing the prominence of
														tinnitus</li>
													<li>Assisted hearing has psychological benefits by reducing fatigue,
														stress and therefore the ability to cope with the tinnitus</li>
													<li>Less attention is paid to the hearing and consequently tinnitus
													</li>
													<li>Ambient noise and internal circuit noise can make the tinnitus
														less audible</li>
													<li>Amplified sounds produce neural activity throughout the auditory
														system which interfere or compete with the central auditory
														representation of tinnitus</li>
													<li>Amplified sound divert attention to complex sounds of greater
														importance or interest such as speech and music</li>
												</ul>
												<br><br>
												<h3>Sound Enrichment</h3>

												One of the most common comments made by tinnitus suffers is that when it
												is quiet <i>‘all I can hear is the tinnitus’</i>. It is important to
												have some other sound for your brain to listen to when all is quiet, eg:
												soft music, a fan, water feature, or any other sound that you are likely
												to find calming. There are inexpensive devices like sound balls that
												produce environmental sounds, and these are particularly useful at
												bedtime. Your Audiologist may introduce certain sounds to help with your
												tinnitus. You can choose from:<br><br>
												<ul>
													<li>Soothing, relaxing sound which may reduce stress and anxiety
														caused by tinnitus</li>
													<li>Background sound which makes it harder for the brain to detect
														the tinnitus</li>
													<li>Interesting sound which helps direct attention away from the
														tinnitus</li>
												</ul>
												<br><br>
												<h3>Combination Hearing Aids and White Noise Generators</h3>

												These are white noise generators with a hearing aid. These are fitted
												when the sufferer finds that the tinnitus sound is very intrusive even
												when they are wearing a hearing aid. We know that sounds like white
												noise and pink noise can help mask out the tinnitus. These modern
												devices allow us to set up the noise with or without the microphone of
												the hearing aid switched on. This allow the audiologist to adjust the
												type of noise you hear and the loudness of it. You can also have
												multiple programmes on your hearing aid to accommodate all needs.

											<h2>How to Help a Hearing Impaired Person Understand You</h2>
											<div>
												<img class="alignright img-responsive"
													src="images/facts/helping-impaired.jpg" alt="">
												When someone speaks, clues are gained not only from what is heard but
												also from what is seen.
												These clues complement and supplement each other, helping the hearing
												impaired person to
												piece together the conversation.
												For the hearing impaired the visual clues of speech become very
												important. Simple actions on
												your part may determine the ease with which these visual clues can be
												followed. The following points will help: <br><br>
												<ul>
													<li>Keep your face visible</li>
													<li>Avoid speaking from another room, or with your head in a
														cupboard</li>
													<li>Do not hide your lip movements behind your hands, a cigarette or
														a pipe</li>
													<li>Do not speak while looking into a newspaper or a book</li>
													<li>Keep your head fairly still when speaking</li>
													<li>Attract the observer's attention before you start talking to
														them so that they can catch the beginning of what is said and
														not just the ending</li>
													<li>Do not shout, speark clearly and not too fast, shouting and
														over-mouthing will alter the lip pattern and speaking too slowly
														may destroy the natural rhythm of speech</li>
													<li>Try to make the subject of conversation as clear as possible
													</li>
													<li>When you are speaking do not distract the observers attention
														with unnecessary hand movements</li>
													<li>If you are wearing sunglasses remove these while speaking</li>
													<li>Repeat the sentence if necessary and then perhaps rephrase what
														you want to say. You may not be aware of this but some words are
														more difficult to lipread than others, eg: the month of March is
														easier to lipread than August. In the word March the shapes
														making the ’M’ and ’ch’ are visible on the lips, but the
														components in August are made inside the mouth so there is
														nothing to see</li>
													<li>Write down any important facts</li>
													<li>Be patient</li>

											</h2>
											<div>
												<img class="alignleft img-responsive"
													src="images/facts/conversation.jpg" alt="">
												When someone speaks, clues are gained from what we hear and what we see.
												You may be able to create a situation so that as many clues as possible
												are available. <br><br>
												<h3>The Best Conditions for Listening</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>A room with soft furnishings (such as carpets, curtains and
														cushions, these absorb sound and so reduce the echo effect)</li>
													<li>Try to reduce the background noises (a tablecloth may lessen the
														noise of plates clattering)</li>
													<li>Ask others to face you, to speak clearly and a little louder
														(mumbling and shouting may make it more difficult for you to
														pick out the words of the speaker)</li>
												</ul>
												<br>
												Remember noisy places such as busy streets, large shops, hospitals and
												railway stations will be more difficult to communicate because of the
												very loud background noise. <br><br>
												<h3>The Best Way to Understand Conversation is to:</h3>
												<ul>
													<li>Make sure the room is well lit</li>
													<li>Have your back to the light source, e.g. the window, so that the
														light falls on the speakers face</li>
													<li>Position yourself 3-6 feet away as lipreading is difficult if
														the speaker is too near or too far away</li>
													<li>Make sure your eyesight has been recently checked, as you don’t
														want to strain your eyes</li>
													<li>Try to watch the speakers lips (you may be surprised at the
														number of clues you pick up without realising it)</li>
													<li>Make sure you are relaxed, as you can lipread better</li>
													<li>Let people know that you have to rely on lipreading, and give
														them an idea of how they can help you:
														<ul>
															<li>By facing you and keeping their heads fairly still.</li>
															<li>By keeping their mouth visible and not hiding the lip
																movements behind their hands, a cigarette or pipe.</li>
															<li>By not shouting but speaking clearly and not too fast
																(shouting alters the lip pattern and speaking too slowly
																may destroy the natural rhythm of speech).</li>
															<li>
																By attracting your attention before speaking so that you
																can catch the beginning of what is being said – not just
																the ending.
															</li>
															<li>
																By not distracting your attention with unnecessary hand
																movements. By removing their glasses before they speak
																to you, as frequently a lot of the understanding of
																speech is through the eyes and dark glasses make it very
																difficult to observe an expression in a person’s eyes.
															</li>
															<li>By making the subject of conversation as clear as
																possible.</li>
															<li>
																By repeating something you haven’t grasped, and then
																perhaps by rephrasing what they want to say, as some
																words are more difficult to lipread than others.
															</li>
														</ul>
													</li>
												</ul>
											</div>
										</li>
										<li class="tab-pane" id="lip-reading">
											<h2>Lip Reading</h2>
											<div>
												<img class="alignleft img-responsive" src="images/facts/lipreading.jpg"
													alt="">
												Lipreading is the art of observing and interpreting the movement of
												lips, tongue and facial expression when helping to convey meaning.

												Most of the elements of speech are visible, although not all of the
												elements can be seen, eg: it is difficult to see a <i>‘k’, ‘g’</i> or
												<i>‘ng’</i> being made, and nothing can be seen for an <i>‘h’</i>
												<br><br>
												Another point to be considered is the same visual picture may be
												presented by different sounds, eg: <i>‘ch’, ‘j’</i> and <i>‘sh’</i> look
												the same but the context is nearly always confusing.
												Remember, spelling in English language does not necessarily correspond
												to the pronunciation.
												<br><br>
												Lipreading, natural hearing, and a hearing aid should all be
												complimentary. Feeling how the movements are made by yourself when
												speaking helps you to know what to look for in others when they are
												speaking. Although your attention will be drawn to analysing the visual
												picture presented by the speech organs, you must aim for quick
												recognition of whole phrases: try to follow the main thought, to
												understand the gist of what the person is saying. This will help you to
												guess the words which are not easy to catch, hence the reason lipreading
												can be considered ‘intelligent guesswork’.
												<br><br>
												It will be helpful to know the subject of the conversation so do not be
												afraid to ask someone what it is, as we are all capable of a certain
												amount of natural lipreading.

												Practicing in front of the mirror is very valuable, as it is better to
												have short regular sessions rather than long ones.
												<br><br>
												Family and friends can help you by not shouting, over exaggerating their
												facial movements and by not splitting up sentences unnaturally. It is
												easier to grasp what is being said if natural phrases are used. The
												natural rhythm of speech should not be altered, even if the words are
												said a little slower than usual. A fast speaker may be asked to slow
												down a little.
												<br><br>
												<h3>The Limitations of Lip Reading</h3>
												Lipreading is more difficult if more than one person is taking part in
												the conversation, as you cannot usually anticipate who will speak next
												and you may consequently miss part of the conversation.
												<br><br>
												Remember to breathe and blink when you lipread! To strengthen the eyes,
												exercises have been suggested, eg: rolling the eyes, or blinking to help
												ease eyestrain. Have your eyesight check frequently or consider
												eyeglasses to help you focus.
												<br><br>
