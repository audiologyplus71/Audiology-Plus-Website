									<h2>Our Team</h2>
									<h4>
										Established just three years ago, Audiology Plus is the AWARD-WINNING Private
										Hearing Clinic that truly understands what it means to experience the joy of
										being able
										to hear.
									</h4>

									<p>Based in Sussex and Surrey, under the leadership of Mr Piotr Swiatek
										(Senior
										Clinical Audiologist and Hearing Aid Consultant), the company works hard to
										ensure
										that every one of its clients with hearing impairment has the chance to live
										life without
										restrictions. There are many things to listen out for throughout the course of a
										human
										life, be it the first words of a child, or the sound of waves upon a shore.
										Being able to
										experience these things is a joy, and Audiology Plus works hard to ensure that
										every one
										of its clients has the chance to experience these things.
									</p>

									<!-- Entry Image
									============================================= -->

									<p>
										Listening and hearing can mean many different things to many different people.
										Where some
										people prefer the silence of their own company, others want to experience all
										the joyful
										sounds of life. Audiology Plus, a private hearing clinic operated in Sussex and
										Surrey, offers
										a comprehensive diagnostic hearing assessment to those who are struggling with
										hearing loss,
										those seeking the fitting of a digital hearing aid and subsequent aftercare, and
										a myriad of
										other issues.
									</p>
									<p>
										For the last three years since the firm’s inception, it has had
										one sole purpose
										and mission as a clinic; to offer excellent clinical care to all patients by
										ensuring they receive
										the best quality healthcare and ongoing aftercare and re-assessments every year.
										Alongside
										the diagnostic work and hearing aid work, Audiology Plus also works with those
										suffering
										from Tinnitus and Balance issues, those needing ear wax removal, and supports
										consultant-
										led ENT clinics in some areas of the two counties in which it operates.
									</p>

									<blockquote>
										<p>
											The last three years has seen Audiology Plus rapidly grow in reputation,
											particularly for
											being a friendly, reliable, and professional private clinic for those
											who
											need
											help to manage
											their hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance. Audiology Plus offers an
											array of
											services to
											determine the right solution for every individual patient. As
											hearing-impaired
											individuals are
											often subjected to prejudice and misconception, the clinic strives to
											remove
											that stigma by
											providing personalised care, education, and the latest technology to its
											patients in order to
											help improve their lives in truly meaningful ways. When delivering
											patient
											care,
											it is
											imperative that one understands the importance of providing the best
											care
											possible for all
											patients. Putting the needs of the patient first is the key to
											delivering
											efficient patient care.
										</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>
										Often, it is the case that the small things make the biggest difference between
										a good
										experience, and a bad experience. Audiology Plus aims to provide a high quality
										of clinical
										care to its patients, always taking notice of the small things and working
										tirelessly to take
										care of them for the patient. However, Audiology Plus is not just a hearing aids
										dispensing
										service. The clinic also offers a professional evaluation for balance assessment
										and
										management, regardless of triggers, be it Vertigo or BPPV, or something else
										entirely.

										Audiology Plus also offer a comprehensive tinnitus management program to ensure
										that
										tinnitus does not negatively impact on the patients. They take pride in its
										provision of
										counselling, through a trained and experience audiologist who will endeavour to
										improve the
										patient’s quality of life. This is hugely beneficial for the patient because the
										effects of tinnitus
										can often be minimized by a combination of counselling and sound stimulation.
										Fractal tones
										are designed to provide relaxation, and may also be used as a tool in sound
										therapy.
									</p>

									<p>
										Sound is widely believed to be helpful in reducing stress, thanks in part to the
										wide range of
										neural structures that are activated when listening to music.

										Much as is the case with many other industries around the world, trends are
										prevalent in the
										medical community, and have affected the service that Audiology Plus provides to
										its
										patients. More and more patients today are choosing a service where there is no
										waiting list
										or hassle to see a hearing professional. Many prefer to deal with a smaller, and
										more private
										audiology company, rather than a large chain on the high street. At Audiology
										Plus, the
										patient is treated as an individual from the beginning of the process, in an
										unhurried and
										relaxed atmosphere. Relaxation is absolutely key, as is getting the best
										possible service to
										those individuals who need it most based on their hearing requirements. For
										example, not
										everyone will be able to get to the clinic when they need to.
									</p>

									<p>
										This could be down to medical or mobility issues, but it should never stop the
										patient from
										accessing the medical treatments that they need in order to enjoy a sensory and
										auditory
										experience to its fullest extent. It is in these times that Audiology Plus will
										use every tool in
										its arsenal to ensure that the patient gets what they need, regardless of
										whether or not they can
										make it to the clinic. The firm makes full use of portable equipment to provide
										audiological
										assessments, hearing aids fittings, hearing aids repairs, and ear wax removal in
										the comfort of
										a patient’s own home. Home visits are suitable for all clients, and it is made
										even more
										appealing and accessible by the fact that a referral from a GP is not required.

										Being based in the South of England has a great many benefits for Audiology
										Plus, and its
										status as a private hearing clinic. Sussex and Surrey are notably well populated
										areas, when
										compared to the remainder of the country, and much of the population has a very
										busy life
										style and a high life expectancy.
									</p>

									<blockquote>
										<p>
											That Hearing Loss only affects older people is a MYTH!!! Around 12 million
											people live
											with hearing loss in the UK and with a busy life style they don’t have time
											to wait for a GP
											referral or a hospital appointment. They want to see the audiologist who
											will test, diagnose
											and supply hearing aids almost immediately.
										</p>
									</blockquote>

										<a href="#"><img src="images/misc/female_audiologist.jpg" alt="Audiologist"></a>
									</div><!-- .entry-image end -->

									<p>
										Looking ahead to the future, Audiology Plus is focused on one thing: expansion.
										The plans
										are in place to grow the clinic into a household name for private hearing care,
										and the skills
										are already there to take it to the next level. A small team maybe, but each
										member strives to
										ensure that the patients receive the best possible care that takes into the
										account the
										individual’s circumstances. Everyone brings a wealth of experience and serious
										education
										from different areas, but all are amalgamated into one outstanding business.
										Armed with the
										relevant training and clear guidelines of expectation, the staff are empowered
										to administer
										excellent care and services for patients. Honesty and dedication characterise
										everything that
										Audiology Plus does, and the clinic should be truly commended for that.
									</p>

									<p>
										Ultimately, the clinic is one of exquisite care and exceptional understanding.
										The joy of
										hearing is one that everybody should be able to experience, and Audiology Plus
										always aim
										to go above and beyond in ensuring that its clients get the care they deserve.
										With dedicated
										and professional staff, exceptional innovation and medical knowledge, and a
										strong desire to
										help as many patients as possible, the sky is the limit for Audiology Plus. It
										is fully deserving

										of this success, and its patients are definitely getting the very best.
										Audiology Plus is
										committed to changing lives so you can &quot;live life without
										restrictions&quot;
